## Limitations
- **Performance**: Large videos may take time to download. No progress bar is included in this version.
- **Dependency on yt-dlp**: Ensure `yt-dlp` is kept up to date to handle YouTube API changes.

## Legal Considerations
- **YouTube Terms of Service**: Downloading videos may violate YouTube's terms unless you have permission or the video is explicitly downloadable. Use this tool responsibly and only for content you have the right to download.
- **Copyright**: Ensure you have permission to download and use the content to avoid legal issues.

## Troubleshooting
- **Invalid URL Error**: Ensure the URL is correct and accessible.
- **No Resolutions Available**: The video may not have downloadable streams, or `yt-dlp` may need updating.
- **Download Fails**: Check your internet connection or try a different resolution.
- **Update**: If errors occur, update requirments:
  ```bash
  pip install --upgrade flask flask-cors yt-dlp
  ```
